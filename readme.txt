Thirdparty readme
-----------------

Introduction:

Thirdparty consists of:

  * A portable thirdparty library for development and distribution of animation and computer 
    graphics applications.

  * A set of libraries, viewers and media provided on Linux, Mac and Windows based platforms.
  
  * A set of configurations to simplify the process of building thirdparty support without the
    knowledge of each individual build system. 
        
  * Up to date support for the latest platforms and versions.
    
  * The thirdparty projects have been tested and patched to work with the following
    platforms:
    
    * MacOSX 10.7 (Snow Lion)

    * CentOS 6.3 (Final) 
    
    In-progress:
  
    * Windows 7

    See PLATFORMS.txt for details.

Thirdparty can be used to:

  * Resolve the most common libraries used for computer graphics applications.

  * Only build a subset of libraries with a default or non-default configuration.

  * Test new versions of libraries before official releases.

Thirdparty is not:

  * A package manager, it's a complement.
