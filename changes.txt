* Build: OIIO, support Webp, hdf5 and field3d.

* Build: Add comment to all custom commands.

  See: https://bugreports.qt-project.org/browse/QTBUG-24365
  
* Project: Add content license for Alembic, OCIO and OpenEXR models/images.

Future ideas (as of Jan 4 2012)

Thirdparty ideas:

* Build: Wget, download of all source packages. Needs more test.

* Build: Win, use MSBuild + existing project vcproj files.
  See: http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ms164311(v=vs.85).aspx

* Build: Docs, add thirdparty doc index.
